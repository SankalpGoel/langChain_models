Language Models are AI systems designed to process, generate, and understand natural
language text.
LLMs - General-purpose models that is used for raw text generation. They take a string(or plain
text) as input and returns a string( plain text). These are traditionally older models and are not
used much now.
Chat Models - Language models that are specialized for conversational tasks. They take a
sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using
plain text). These are traditionally newer models and used more in comparison to the LLMs.

Open-source language models are freely available AI models that can be downloaded,
modified, fine-tuned, and deployed without restrictions from a central provider. Unlike closed-
source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, open-source
models allow full control and customization.
